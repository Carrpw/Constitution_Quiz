# Elevator Pitch: Constitutional Quiz App

## Description:
Our app provides users with a resource they can use to improve their understanding of American civics and political history. Our motivation for creating this app was a desire to help regular Americans improve their knowledge of basic American civics in a fun and engaging way. In order to get this app up-and-running, we used React.js, Lodash, React-Modal, Bcryptjs, Express, Morgan, Axios, Mongoose, and Passport.
